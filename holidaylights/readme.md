# Holidays Light System

I wanted to create automated Christmas light system that include little hard and software. Currently use both Christmas and Halloween.

This project is to document what I did and to step to recreate what I have done. 

I created with all opensource.

|8 Channel Relay| [<img src="./pictures/relay-connect.jpg" width="250"/>](./pictures/relay-connect.jpg)|



Outlet box was easyer part has not much changes over time. I number then so in software I can have on outlet on all times. Allows for lazer lights on. They do not work with power being on / off fast. 

One hardest part. I found out that wires were pulling out trying to get all the wires together in small area
