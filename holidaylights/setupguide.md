The following is how I setup my system:

#### Raspberry OS:


#### Lightshow PI Setup:
- create folder for music like `mkdir -p ~/music/christmas/`
- create folder for software `mkdir -p ~/git/`
- clone software `git clone https://bitbucket.org/togiles/lightshowpi.git` 
- Run their setup proceess. `cd lightshowpi && python install.py`
- created self setup.sh in file with my own config. 
- Get layout of pins for device by using `gpio readall` I like to do that form ssh
